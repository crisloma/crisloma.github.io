        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>New technologies are radically advancing our freedoms, but they are also enabling unparalleled invasions of privacy. National and international laws have yet to catch up with the evolving need for privacy that comes with new digital technologies. Respect for individuals' autonomy, anonymous speech, and the right to free association must be balanced against legitimate concerns like law enforcement.</p>
		<p>This project aim to provide accessible, up-to-date information about the different laws and norms available. Academia, civil society 
groups,  students  and  policy-makers  with  varying  levels  of  familiarity  with data protection and privacy-related  themes  
should be able to easily navigate the content, as well as use it for educational and policy development purposes.</P>
      <p> In addition, it seeks to address the lack of systematized information on data protection initiatives and regulation by 
	      promoting a comprehensive approach to these developments.</p>
